# 3dsfindskitten: a zen simulation for the 3DS [WIP]

3dsfindskitten is a port of robotfindskitten to the 3DS. I've ported this to the HP 95LX once (mostly to get everything width/height-independent and monochrome), so I'm clearly qualified to port this to the 3DS.

You are a robot in a field of objects, many of them not kitten. Find kitten. It's that simple.

D-pad to move robot (maybe I'll allow for using the analogue stick, but why would you), SELECT to reset, START to exit.
