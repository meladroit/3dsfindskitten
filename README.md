# 3dsfindskitten: a zen simulation for the 3DS

3dsfindskitten is a port of robotfindskitten to the 3DS. I've ported this to the HP 95LX once (mostly to get everything width/height-independent and monochrome), so I'm clearly qualified to port this to the 3DS.

You are a robot in a field of objects, many of them not kitten. Find kitten. It's that simple.

D-pad or analogue stick to move robot, SELECT to reset, START to exit. The executable needs a text file named 'nki' in the same folder, for purposes of describing the non-kitten objects. Descriptions are allowed to be one line each of up to 256 characters.
